### How to use
Destroy files definitely unrecoverable even by fluorescent technicalr.

create the ./destroy directory on your machine and reference it when running sewer.

```bash
    sewer /user/destroy
```

### how does destruction happen? 
sewer modifies byte by byte of each file inside the destroy directory and then delete. 
making any type of recovery impossible, 
as the bytes were modified before the file was destroyed.
